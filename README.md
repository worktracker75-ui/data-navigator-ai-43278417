**Project Description**
A GenAI-based assistant that connects to SQL databases, reads data, performs analysis, and generates human-like insights using LLMs. The system automates data exploration, summarization, and reporting without needing manual queries.

**Problem it Solves** :
Most business users struggle to write SQL queries or understand complex datasets. This tool removes that barrier by automatically fetching data, analyzing patterns, and producing clear insights instantly. It speeds up decision-making and reduces dependency on analysts.

**Use your preferred IDE**

You can work on this project using any IDE you are comfortable with — such as VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, or any other environment that supports Python development.


**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

1. Python
Core programming language for building the entire pipeline.

2. LangChain
Used for LLM orchestration, prompt templates, chaining logic, and connecting data to the model.

3. OpenAI API (LLMs)
Generates insights, summaries, and reasoning-based responses from SQL output.

4. SQL Databases (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server)
Data storage layer that the assistant connects to for query execution.

5. Pandas
For data cleaning, analysis, transformation, and tabular operations.

6. Secure Database Connectors
To safely connect and query SQL databases (e.g., sqlalchemy, mysql-connector, psycopg2).

7. Caching System
Reduces repeated calls and improves performance (e.g., in-memory cache or LangChain cache).

8. Modular Architecture
Allows adding new data sources, plugins, and custom logic easily.

9. Logging & Auditing
Tracks user queries and LLM interactions for compliance.
